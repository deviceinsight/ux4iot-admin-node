Minimal tested and fully functional NPM package template project for ES6+ Javascript.

## About this package

This template is intended to allow you to **start developing immediatly** with a working set
of tools and scripts that play well together.

It is little opinionated to the point, that only the most basic tools are integrated.
If you want a different flavour you can fork this project and easily replace the tools or add new ones.

## Which tools are used?

## Getting started

In your backend code, initialize the admin client:

```javascript
const ux4iotAdmin = initializeAdmin({
	connectionString: 'HostName=yourux4iotinstance.com;Key=supersecret',
});
```

In order to generate subscription tokens:

```javascript
const subscriptionToken = ux4iotAdmin.createSubscriptionToken({
	deviceIds: ['somedevice', 'anotherdevice'],
	telemetry: ['temperature', 'pressure'],
	accessToAllTelemetryValues: false,
});
```

## Code Quality

We use `standard` as opinionated but zero-config linter.
You can run lint in two modes:

##### lint

```bash
$ npm run lint
```

##### lint with auto fixing

```bash
$ npm run lint:fix
```

## Run the tests

We use mocha and chai with a mostly (but not strict) behavioural style for testing.
You can run the tests in three different contexts:

##### Single run

```bash
$ npm run test
```

##### Watch mode

```bash
$ npm run test:watch
```
